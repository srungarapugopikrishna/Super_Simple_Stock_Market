Run main.py

Data is populated automaticaly.
Values differ for every run.

Static constraints:
I am creating a whole of 50 trades and assigning them to stocks.

While calculating Volume Weighted Stock Price based on trades in past  5 minutes, I am assuming that this will be None if there are no trades happened for this stock in the past 5 minutes.

As a result if it is None, GBCE All Share Index will be None.
